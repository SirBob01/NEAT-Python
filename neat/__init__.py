"""NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) is a 
genetic algorithm developed by Ken Stanley that applies 
genetic algorithms to machine learning. This algorithm 
gradually breeds and mutates the best genomes (neural 
networks) with the highest fitness or performance scores 
over the course of generations.

	http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.ec02.pdf

This is a Python implementation of the algorithm for 
use in simulations, games, or general machine learning 
problems.
